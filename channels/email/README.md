# Email Channel Schema Plugin

The `@engine9/schemas/channels/email` plugin defines email-channel search and engagement segments. It does not create its own tables. Segment builds read `global_message`, `input`, and `timeline` rows produced by email message plugins.

It depends on `@engine9/schemas/person` because membership is always a set of people.

## Search

`emailEngagement` finds people who opened or clicked email in a rolling window.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `windowDays` | Rolling window: `30`, `60`, or `90` days |
| `timelineEntryType` | `EMAIL_OPEN` or `EMAIL_CLICK` |
| `pluginId` | Optional. When set, only that plugin's inputs are included. When empty, scope comes from the segment universe instead |

The search looks at `timeline` rows whose `entry_type_id` matches the engagement type and whose `ts` is in the window. It always joins `timeline.input_id = input.id`, so only timeline entries for inputs present in the build are counted.

## Segments

Predefined audiences shipped with this schema plugin. On install, each key becomes a `segment` row whose definition path is `@engine9/schemas/channels/email:segments:<key>`.

Every segment here uses the same **universe** and the `emailEngagement` search. The universe and the search do different jobs, and both are required:

- **Universe** chooses *which email sends* can contribute entries: messages on the email channel published in the last **90 days** (`global_message.channel = 'email'` and `publish_date` within 90 days). Those message ids become the `input` rows for the build.
- **Search** chooses *which people* from those sends belong in the audience: a recent open or click on the timeline, inside the segment's rolling window.

An open or click on a message published more than 90 days ago does not count, even if the entry itself is recent. `pluginId` is left empty so the universe, not a hardcoded plugin, decides which message stores are scanned.

## Reports and UI

This schema plugin does not ship reports. Email engagement and fundraising dashboards live on `@engine9/plugins/reports/messaging` (`email`, `email_transactions`). See [`plugins/reports/messaging/README.md`](../../../plugins/reports/messaging/README.md).
